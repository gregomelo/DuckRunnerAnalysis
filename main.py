"""
Main execution entry point for the DuckRunnerAnalysis package.

This module provides the command-line entry point for the DuckRunnerAnalysis
project. It can be used to initialize the application, perform setup routines,
or run data analysis workflows once they are implemented.

Notes
-----
Currently, it only prints a startup message for development validation.

    This function serves as the default execution path when the module is

    This conditional ensures that the `main` function is only executed when

    ``python -m duckrunneranalysis``), and not when it is imported as a
